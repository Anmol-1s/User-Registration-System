# User-Registration-System
The User Registration System is a web-based application developed using JSP, JDBC,Servlets, and MySQL to allow users to register and store their details in a database. The system captures user information, including first name, surname, email, password, city, and gender, and securely stores it in a MySQL database.

The registration form is implemented using JSP (register.jsp), which collects user input and submits it to a Servlet (register.java). The servlet processes the form data and inserts it into the valueinsert table within the register database.
